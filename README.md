# CrewAI-Builder

I've created a comprehensive CrewAI Team Builder application that allows you to visually build and manage AI agent teams for crewAI. The application follows Apple-level design aesthetics with a clean interface, consistent spacing, and thoughtful interactions.

The app features a modular architecture with well-organized components for teams, agents, tasks, and visualizations. You can create complex agent workflows, define dependencies between tasks, and export your teams as ready-to-use Python code for the crewAI framework.

This first version will focus on providing an intuitive interface for creating, visualizing, and managing AI agent teams.

Core Features:

Team creation and management with customizable properties
Agent creation with role definitions, goals, and backstories
Task and workflow configuration for agent interactions
Visual team builder with drag-and-drop functionality
Export/import functionality for crewAI integration
Real-time team visualization and preview
Role-based permission settings for agents
Team performance analytics dashboard
